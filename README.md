This project was originally published in [Deploying a scalable web application with Docker and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@joycelin.codes/deploying-a-scalable-web-application-with-docker-and-kubernetes-a5000a06c4e9) from the [Postman Engineering blog](https://medium.com/postman-engineering).

### Pre-requisites for local development
1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and
1. Install yarn globally with `npm install -g yarn`  
1. A container platform like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Remember to start Docker on your machine.

### For Development

    npm install // install dependencies
    npm start // start web app on 3000
    npm run start-server // start backend server on 5500
    
    open http://localhost:3000 // open web app

### For Production

1. **Environment variables**: Create a new file called `.env` located in the root of your project directory. Add your production domain and docker hub username. See the example in `.env.example`. 
1. **API tests**: If you plan to run Postman tests, then update the `bin/deploy.sh` file by selecting a method of running your Postman tests. To run either of the last 2 options, update your Postman collection UID and environment UID in `bin/deploy.sh` and also add your [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) key to the `.env` file you created in the previous step.
1. **Describe deployment**: Update the `deployment-prod.yaml` file to describe your backend deployment. Update the `deployment-ui-prod.yaml` file to describe your frontend deployment. These files will include your container image, resource allocation, the desired number of replicas, and other important information.
1. **Deploy**: Run the deployment script
    
`npm run deploy // run API tests, then deploy frontend and backend to production`

For the deployment, I used a hosted Kubernetes provider called [Kubesail](https://kubesail.com/) that creates a free managed namespace. However, the underlying deployment utility [`npx deploy-to-kube`](https://github.com/kubesail/deploy-to-kube) supports any Kubernetes cluster. By running it inside your app's directory, this utility will automatically generate a Dockerfile (if it doesn't exist), build and push deployment images, generate Kubernetes configuration files (if it doesn't exist), and trigger a deployment on your Kubernetes cluster.
